==========

Actionscript 3 RPC libraries for flash-remoting(amf0), xml-rpc, json-rpc

Introduction
------------

As3 RPC lib is a set of libraries that can be used with Flex 2 or AS 3 to invoke remote procedure calls using:

 * [AMF0](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/amf/amf0_spec_121207.pdf)
 * [XML-RPC](http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec)
 * [JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification)

Usage mimics the RemoteObject which is available natively in Flex 2 in an effort to make usage in existing frameworks (e.g. Cairngorm) and design pattern (e.g. Token pattern) easy as possible.
