Actionscript 3 RPC libraries for flash-remoting(amf0), xml-rpc, json-rpc

Actionscript 3 RPC Library

Introduction
As3 RPC lib is a set of libraries that can be used with Flex 2 or AS 3 to invoke remote procedure calls using:

AMF0 (Flash Remoting MX)
XML-RPC
JSON-RPC (Coming Soon)
Usage mimics the RemoteObject which is available natively in Flex 2 in an effort to make usage in existing frameworks (e.g. Cairngorm) and design pattern (e.g. Token pattern) easy as possible.
